## MVP Goals
- User AUTH
- User can login and make a bear avatar
- User can load into game room
- User can interact with mailbox to send letter to other players

## Post-MVP Goals
- Websockets
- Animation
- Music
- A secondary room instance
- Mini games

## Database Schemas
_Please provide a sample of how you intend to build your models. A Schema object for each of your models is ideal._

```
bearSchema
const { model, Schema } = require("mongoose");


// Create a bear

const bearSchema = new Schema(
    {
        
        color: {type: String, required: true},

    },
    {timestamps: true}
)

module.exports = model("Bear", bearSchema);
```
```
letterSchema 
const { model, Schema } = require("mongoose");

// letters
const letterSchema = new Schema(
  {
    title: { type: String, required: true },
    recipient: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User", required: true },
    letter: { type: String, require: true },
    sender: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User", required: true }
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);

module.exports = model("letter", letterSchema);

```
```
userSchema
const { model, Schema } = require("mongoose");


// User
const userSchema = new Schema({
    username: { type: String, required: true, unique: true},
    email: { type: String, required: true},
    //password Auth
    bear: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Bear", required: true  }
},
{timestamps: true});


module.exports = model("User", userSchema);
```

## Whimsical
_Please post your application's full stack diagram here as an IMAGE, not as a link._

## Wireframes
_For each screen you intend on showing, provide a wireframe for both desktop and mobile._

## SWOT Analysis

## Robert
### Strengths:
- I think I am good at knowing what needs to do done overall for a feature to work and then splitting it up into smaller steps 

### Weaknesses:
- Overthinking and trying to implement a more complicated version in one go rather than first implement a solid basic version.

### Opportunities:
- Managing tasks will help me code in a team environment better

### Threats:
- Regularly committing, updating trello

## Rachel
### Strengths:
- Art assets/vision/ux design
### Weaknesses:
- Time management (in relation to CSS/Art assets)
### Opportunities:
- I want to learn as much as I can about web sockets and game mechanics as possible!
### Threats:
- Combining work from three persons without merge issues


## Ben
### Strengths:
- I have a pretty good handle on the backend 

### Weaknesses:
- Staying on track and not going down rabbit holes 

### Opportunities:
- Managing tasks will help me code in a team environment better

### Threats:
- Keeping the README and kanban board up to date
- Managing my OWN time
